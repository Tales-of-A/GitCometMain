# Protect Main! 🛡️

> Your `main` branch is under attack by buggy code ⚠️. It's your job to protect it!

## About The Game 🎮

**Protect Main!** is a simple, fast-paced arcade game for developers, inspired by classics like _Space Invaders_. Instead of aliens, your screen is filled with falling lines of code ⌨️.

Your mission is to act as the ultimate code reviewer: let the clean code pass to add stars ✨ to your repo, but quickly click or tap to destroy any buggy lines 💥 before they get committed to the bottom of the screen. If a bug gets through, you lose a life 💔. Lose all your lives, and the project is broken! ❌

## Features ✨

- **🕹️ Classic Arcade Action:** Simple, addictive, tap-to-destroy gameplay.
- **👩‍💻 Developer-Themed Fun:** A world of code snippets, bugs, and repository stars designed for developers.
- **📈 Dynamic Difficulty:** As your score increases, the code falls faster and the bugs get trickier to spot.
- **⭐ Simple Scoring & Lives:** Rack up stars for your repo, but be careful—three strikes (missed bugs) and you're out!
